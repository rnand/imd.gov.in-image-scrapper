This script will extract satellite images of India published regulary by Indian Meteorological Department at imd.gov.in.

My final goal is to create a gif or avi/mov/mp4 file with the sequence of images gathered at regular intervals, so that it can be played back in a smooth animation.

**Still a WIP**
