This script will extract satellite images of India published regulary by Indian Meteorological Department at imd.gov.in.

Currently it only works for aquiring one image. Soon, it will be able to download archived images, and grab latest images periodically. Also, I wish to add different options to download other varieties of maps such as IR, visible spectrum, rain, forest fire etc which are available from IMD.

My final goal is to create a gif or avi/mov/mp4 file with the sequence of images gathered at regular intervals, so that it can be played back in a smooth animation. The website of Indian Meteorological Department has this feature, but it can only animate a maximum of 24 images.

**Still a WIP**
